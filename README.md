# Blue-Line-Following-Robot

MATLAB script for connecting to AgileX LIMO. The computer running the script must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the robot, and the LIMO's IP address must be manually modified in the script (port remains unchanged), both of which allow the LIMO to be remotely controlled via TCP.

LIMO speed is hard-coded and can be modified, however
